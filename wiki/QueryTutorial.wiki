= Query language syntax =

   * *{{{<node1> isa(<relation>) <node2>}}}*: matches any edge that goes from the second node into the first, and which matches a relation type that is dominated by the given relation in the relation hierarchy. 
      * {{{$X isa(subj) $Y}}}: find all subject relations into $X from $Y
      * {{{$X isa(ANA) 113}}}: find all anaphoric relations into $X from node 113.
