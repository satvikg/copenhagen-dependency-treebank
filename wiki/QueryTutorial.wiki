= Query language syntax =

   * *{{{<node1> <relation> <node2>}}}*: the first node is connected to the second via an in-coming edge with the given relation name (quoted or unqouted). 
      * {{{$X "subj" $Y}}}: find all edges into $X from $Y with label "subj".
      * {{{$X coref $Y}}}: find all edges into $X from $Y with label "coref".
   * *{{{<node1> isa(<relation>) <node2>}}}*: the first node is connected to the second via an in-coming edge whose relation name is dominated by the given relation in the relation hierarchy. 
      * {{{$X isa(subj) $Y}}}: find all subject-type relations into $X from $Y.
      * {{{$X isa(ANA) $Y}}}: find all anaphor-type relations into $X from $Y.
