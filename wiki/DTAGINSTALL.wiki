#summary DTAG Installation HOWTO

= Installation of DTAG =

= Requirements =

The annotation program DTAG only runs on UNIX machines, and requires Perl, subversion, and the !PostScript viewer GV. 

= Download =

To download DTAG, you have to check out the source code with anonymous subversion as described in the [http://code.google.com/p/copenhagen-dependency-treebank/source/checkout checkout] page. 

= Installation =

== Ubuntu users ==

The easiest way to install DTAG is to install Ubuntu on your machine, and open a terminal window where you can execute the following commands, which will change to root user and download and install DTAG as well as all packages on which it depends:

  {{{sudo su}}}<br>
  {{{wget http://www.buch-kromann.dk/cdt/install-root.sh}}}<br>
  {{{sh install-root.sh}}}

Follow the instructions on the screen. Enter a blank Google code name if you are not in the CDT project. Logout as root when finished, and execute:

  {{{wget http://www.buch-kromann.dk/cdt/install.sh}}}<br>
  {{{sh install.sh}}}

This will also download the entire CDT treebank. You can then run DTAG with the command:

  {{{perl ~/cdt/dtag/dtag.pl}}}

== Other UNIX users (including Mac OS X users) ==

You will have to install Subversion (svn), Perl, and GV manually first, and then execute the commands in the scripts install-root.sh and install.sh manually, adapting the commands to your specific system. If you find out how to install DTAG on your system, I will include your installation instructions and scripts here if you send me a [mailto:matthias@buch-kromann.dk mail].

== Windows users ==

DTAG does not work on Windows, but you can run Ubuntu as a Windows application via VMWare and install DTAG under Ubuntu.
