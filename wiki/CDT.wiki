= The Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks =

The purpose of the Copenhagen Dependency Treebank project is to create linguistically annotated text collections (treebanks) on the basis of the dependency-based grammar formalism Discontinuous Grammar (Buch-Kromann 2009). The treebanks created in the project can be used to train natural language parsers, syntax-based machine translation systems, and other statistically based natural language applications. The treebanks are based on a unified dependency annotation, where texts are analyzed as a single dependency structure that spans all levels of analysis, from morphology to discourse. 

The project has so far resulted in three sets of treebanks:

   * *CDT1:* The 100,000 word Danish Dependency Treebank, which was used as training material in the CoNLL 2006 shared task.
   * *CDT2:* The 100,000 word Danish-English Parallel Dependency Treebank
   * *CDT3:* The 40-50,000 Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks for Danish, English, German, Italian and Spanish (work-in-progress)

The main status of the treebanks is listed below. 

|| *Treebank* || *Languages* || *Annotation* || *Word tokens* || *Status* ||
|| CDT1 || Danish || part-of-speech, syntax || 100,000 || complete ||
|| CDT2 || Danish to English || part-of-speech, syntax || 100,000 || near complete ||
|| CDT3 || Danish to English, Italian, Spanish, German || part-of-speech, syntax with extended adverbial annotation, discourse structure, anaphora, morphology || 40-50,000 expected || in progress ||

We expect CDT2 and CDT3 to be completed in the fall of 2010.

== License == 

The treebanks are released to the computational linguistics and natural language processing community under an open-source license (the Lesser Gnu Public License). 

== Downloading the treebank ==

The development version of the treebank is stored in the [http://code.google.com/p/copenhagen-dependency-treebank/source/checkout CDT Google Code repository]. You can also [http://code.google.com/p/copenhagen-dependency-treebank/source/browse/#svn/trunk browse the treebank sources online].

== Documentation ==

The currently best description of the treebank is given in Buch-Kromann et al (2009). 
The relations used in the trebank are described in detail in our most recent draft [http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/manual/cdt-manual.pdf annotation manual], a work-in-progress which is undergoing major revisions at the moment. We have also created a [http://treebank.dk/map treebank map] which can be used to quickly get statistics and samples of the dependency relations used in the current treebank (it may be slightly outdated). Finally, you can [http://code.google.com/p/copenhagen-dependency-treebank/source/browse/#svn/trunk browse the treebank sources online].
