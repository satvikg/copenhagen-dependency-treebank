= Introduction =

The Copenhagen Dependency Treebank is an ongoing project which seeks to create linguistically annotated translation corpora (parallel treebanks). The treebanks are based on a unified dependency annotation, where texts are analyzed as a single dependency structure that spans all levels of analysis, from morphology to discourse.
