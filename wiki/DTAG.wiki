== DTAG ==

The Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks have been created with the [http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/dtag DTAG] treebank tool. DTAG also allows the user to search a treebank for syntactic constructions, specified with a constraint-based query language. DTAG is distributed with the Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks in the directory dtag.
