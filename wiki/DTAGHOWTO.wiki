== DTAG HOWTO ==

This document describes how to use DTAG for different tasks. 

=== Starting DTAG ===

Start DTAG by clicking on the "DTAG" icon on your desktop. If you are 
connected to the Internet, you should update DTAG first by clicking on the "Update DTAG" icon. 

*Note.* At CBS, you have to enter your username and password before you get a
network connection: open a browser by clicking on the Firefox icon at the top
menu bar, open an arbitrary internet page, and enter your CBS username and
password when prompted. You can choose wireless LAN by clicking on the Network 
icon at the top menu bar on the right.

=== Tasks and revision control ===

  * *{{{opentask}}}*: open the first unfinished task that has been assigned to you (the _current task_).
  * *{{{closetask}}}*: mark the current task as closed, eg, tell DTAG that you are completely done with it so that {{{opentask}}} will return another task.
  * *{{{tasks}}}*: open your task list in an editor; you can then reorder the tasks (if you want to do them in a different order), add tasks, or reopen tasks that you have closed inadvertently.
  * *{{{save}}}*: save your current work on your hard disk (you should do this frequently). 
  * *{{{update}}}*: update your local copy of the central CDT repository with all the annotations.
  * *{{{commit}}}*: upload your local annotations to the central CDT repository.
