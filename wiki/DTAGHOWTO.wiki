== DTAG HOWTO ==

This document describes how to use DTAG for different tasks. 

=== Starting and closing DTAG ===

Start DTAG by clicking on the "DTAG" icon on your desktop. If you are 
connected to the Internet, you should update DTAG first by clicking on the "Update DTAG" icon. 

*Note.* At CBS, you have to enter your username and password before you get a
network connection: open a browser by clicking on the Firefox icon at the top
menu bar, open an arbitrary internet page, and enter your CBS username and
password when prompted. You can choose wireless LAN by clicking on the Network 
icon at the top menu bar on the right.

  * *{{{viewer}}}*: show the current graph in a window (if the viewer doesn't display correctly, simply restart the viewer by closing the viewer window and typing {{{viewer}}} again.
  * *{{{manual}}}*: open a web browser with a local copy of the CDT treebank.dk website; click on the "Dependency maps" link in order to get access to more than 10.000 searchable treebank examples. 
  * *command line:* you can use up- and down-arrows to see previous commands, left- and right-arrows to edit previous commands; hit return to re-execute the command. 

=== Tasks and revision control ===

  * *{{{opentask}}}*: open the first unfinished task that has been assigned to you (the _current task_).
  * *{{{closetask}}}*: mark the current task as closed, eg, tell DTAG that you are completely done with it so that {{{opentask}}} will return another task.
  * *{{{save}}}*: save your current work on your hard disk (you should do this frequently). 
  * *{{{update}}}*: update your local copy of the central CDT repository with all the annotations.
  * *{{{commit}}}*: upload your local annotations to the central CDT repository.
  * *{{{exit}}}*: close DTAG (without saving!)
  * *{{{tasks}}}*: open your task list in an editor; you can then reorder the tasks (if you want to do them in a different order), add tasks, or reopen tasks that you have closed inadvertently.

=== Annotating alignment graphs ===

  * *{{{<nodes> [<label>] <nodes>}}}*: create alignment -- eg, {{{1+3 label 2..7}}} or {{{a1..3 a1..3}}} if you want to align the nodes 1..3 on the a-side with themselves. You do not have to provide a label.
  * *{{{del <node>}}}*: delete all alignment edges at the given node, eg, {{{del a3}}}. 
  * *{{{ok}}}*: accept all the red edges proposed by the autoaligner.
  * *{{{autoalign -off}}}*: turn off the autoaligner (started automatically by {{{opentask}}}).

Advanced commands:

=== Annotating dependency graphs ===

  * *{{{<node> <label> <node>}}}*: create a dependency edge stating that the first node is a {{{label}}} dependent of the second node (eg, {{{23 subj 45}}}). The dependency is drawn as an arrow that starts at the governor (head word) and ends at the dependent (subordinate word).
  * *{{{edel <node>}}}*: delete all in-coming edges at the given node.
  * *{{{edgel <node> <label> <node>}}}*: delete the given dependency edge.

=== Annotating word segments ===

=== Comparing annotations with diff ===

=== Searching dependency graphs ===

=== Printing to PDF files ===

=== Other useful commands ===
